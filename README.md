# CODSOFT_TASK_02
This code is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. **Functions for Arithmetic Operations**:
   - `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
   - `subtract(x, y)`: Returns the difference between `x` and `y`.
   - `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of `x` and `y`.
   - `divide(x, y)`: Returns the quotient of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, it returns an error message to avoid division by zero.

2. **Main Program Logic** (`main` function):
   - The program runs in an infinite loop (`while True`) to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.
   - It displays a menu with five options: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, and Exit.
   - The user's choice is read and validated. If the choice is invalid, the user is prompted again.
   - For valid arithmetic choices (1 to 4), the program prompts the user to enter two numbers. If the input is not numeric, it prints an error message and restarts the loop.
   - Based on the user's choice, the corresponding arithmetic function is called with the input numbers, and the result is printed.
   - If the user chooses '5', the program prints "Goodbye!" and exits the loop, ending the program.

3. **Entry Point**:
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that `main()` is called only when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.
  
   - This code represents a simple interactive command-line calculator. Theoretical aspects include:

1. **Modular Design**:
   - The code is organized into separate functions for each arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This modular approach enhances code readability and maintainability.

2. **Control Flow**:
   - The main logic is implemented within a `while True` loop, creating an infinite loop that continues until explicitly broken. This allows the program to repeatedly prompt the user for input.
   - User input is captured and processed to determine the desired operation or to exit the program.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - A text-based menu is presented to the user, allowing them to select an arithmetic operation or exit the program. This interaction is handled using print statements for the menu and input statements for capturing user choices and numbers.
   - Input validation is performed to ensure that the user provides numeric values for the calculations. If invalid input is detected, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted again.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Division by zero is explicitly checked in the `divide` function to prevent runtime errors and provide a user-friendly error message.
   - A try-except block is used to catch and handle invalid numeric inputs, ensuring the program does not crash and provides feedback to the user.

5. **Conditional Logic**:
   - The program uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the user's choice. It also includes a condition to exit the program when the user chooses the exit option.

6. **Entry Point Check**:
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct ensures that the `main()` function is executed only when the script is run directly. This is a common Python idiom to allow code to be reusable as a module.

In summary, the code is a basic implementation of a command-line calculator with structured functions, user input handling, error checking, and control flow mechanisms to facilitate continuous user interaction until termination.
